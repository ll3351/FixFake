### Setup
The running environment is Jupyter Notebook and the created SQL database is based on sqlite3. For online picture parsing, urllib is used. For image resolution, I made use of cv2 to help me about that.

### How to run Project
Just cloning the ipynd file from my repo. Before running the whole project, you need to change the local file path to make sure all the files can be downloaded to your own computer or your environment. 
The project has been slided to 3 parts: online image parsing, image loading, Creating SQL database and put the images into the database as BLOB form.
